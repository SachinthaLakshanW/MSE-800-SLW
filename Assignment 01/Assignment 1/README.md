Car Rental System
Overview

The Car Rental System is a command-line application developed in Python. It provides functionality for customers to register, log in, view available cars, and make bookings. Administrators can add cars and manage bookings, including approval and rejection.

The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, SQLite for persistent data storage, and standard design patterns to ensure modularity and maintainability.
