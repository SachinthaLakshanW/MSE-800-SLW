1. Class Diagram
Shows the main things in the library system: books, members, borrow records, librarians, and the system itself.
Each thing has only the important information (like book title, member name, borrow date).
Shows how things are connected: members borrow books, borrow records keep track of borrowed books.
Why it works: It helps organize the system so we know what information is needed for borrowing, returning, and fines.

2. Use Case Diagram
Shows who can do what in the library system.
Member can search, borrow, return books, and pay fines.
Librarian can add/remove books and help with returns.
Why it works: It shows all the main actions in the library and who does them, making it clear how the system is used.

3. Sequence Diagram (Borrow Book)
Shows step by step what happens when a member borrows a book.
Member asks to borrow → system checks availability → creates a record → member gets confirmation.
Why it works: It makes the borrowing process easy to follow and shows how the system and member interact.

4. Activity Diagram (Return Book)
Shows what happens when a member returns a book.
Steps: member returns → system finds record → checks if late → calculates fine → updates book availability → gives confirmation.
Includes member paying fine if needed.
Why it works: It clearly shows the return process and what the system does for each step.
